## Overview

Thank you for reviewing my code. I chose this Frontend Mentor challenge so I could practice working with API's. I look forward to taking on more difficult challenges where I can practice these skills.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon

## My process

I started with building out the javascript functionality. Then once I had the advice data successfully appending to the HTML I went ahead and designed the HTML layout then finished with the CSS styling.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I still have a few things to work on when it comes to fully understanding the way data is passed around between different servers/browsers. Always working on improving my understanding of accessibillity.
